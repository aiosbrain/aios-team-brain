# AIOS Team Brain — Architecture

Mission control for agentic teamwork: a shared, queryable memory + coordination layer.
Contributor repos (and the ingestion sidecar) sync tier-tagged content into the brain;
the dashboard surfaces it and answers grounded natural-language questions. Self-host
portable: plain SQL migrations, Postgres-backed rate limiting, no Vercel-only deps.

## Sources of truth

Where each piece of state lives, who may write it, who reads it, and how access is enforced.
Reason from this table, not from a random call site.

| State | Store (table) | Writer | Readers | Tier/access enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Synced content | `items`, `item_versions` | **`lib/ingest` only** (single-writer guarded) | dashboard pages, `/api/v1/items`, `lib/query/retrieve`, okf-bundle, metrics | app-code tier isolation (no RLS) — API ✅, dashboard ✅ (`lib/auth/visibility` choke-point, guarded) |
| Dense index (OPTIONAL) | `item_chunks` (embeddings; **not** in `schema.sql` — `postgres/optional/pgvector.sql`, load via `pg:schema:vector`) | **`lib/query/dense-index` only** (single-writer guarded; chunk+embed, idempotent on `items.content_sha256`) — incremental in the ingest scheduler + `npm run embed:backfill` | `lib/query/dense-search` (HNSW cosine → RRF-fused into `retrieve`) | opt-in (`EMBEDDINGS_URL` + pgvector present, else a complete no-op); dense hits tier-filtered on **live `items.access`** — no `external` leak (guarded by the dense data-mechanics test) |
| Tasks | `tasks` | `lib/ingest` (sync rows — incl. inbound Plane/Linear/GitHub import, each into a dedicated `plane-<id>`/`linear-<team>`/`github-<owner>-<repo>` project) + `app/actions/tasks.ts` (UI; mints `ui-` row_key) + `lib/work-events` (merged-work completion) | dashboard, `/api/v1/tasks`, PM sync | team-scoped; `origin='ui'` rows survive sync diff; v1.2 hierarchy fields `parent_row_key`/`labels`/`priority` (parent integrity — exists + acyclic — enforced in `lib/ingest`); `body` is dashboard/DB-only (never in the markdown contract) |
| Task PM links | `task_pm_links` | `lib/ingest` (optional task-row PM metadata) + PM backfill | dashboard task badges, `lib/pm-sync` | team-scoped; stores provider IDs/status only, never secrets; v1.2 adds `last_projected_status`/`projection_fingerprint` (skip-detection) + `provider_seen_status` (Phase 5 divergence) |
| Primary PM provider | `teams.primary_pm_provider` | Admin → Integrations (`setPrimaryPmProvider`, admin-gated + audited) | `lib/pm-sync` projection | the single PM tool the brain projects into; null = projection no-ops / sole-enabled fallback |
| Work events | `work_events` | `POST /api/v1/work-events` → `lib/work-events` | Admin → PM sync health | team-tier only; unresolved events are preserved for reconciliation |
| Decisions | `decisions` | `lib/ingest` (sync rows) + `app/actions/decisions.ts` (UI; `source_item_id` NULL) | dashboard, `/api/v1/decisions` | team-scoped; UI rows (`source_item_id` NULL) never diff-deleted; writeback tier-scoped by `audience` |
| Policy rules | `policies` | **`lib/policy/manage` only** (validated + audited) via the **Admin → Policies** editor (`savePolicy`/`togglePolicy`/`removePolicy`, admin-gated) | `lib/policy.authorize` (enabled-only) + the editor (`listAllPolicies`, incl. disabled) | admin-gated (the whole `/admin` area is) |
| Approvals | `approval_requests` | `lib/policy.fileApprovalRequest` (queue) + `lib/actions.resolveApproval` (decide) — decided from the **Admin → Approvals** queue (`decideApproval`, admin-gated; approve resumes the action with the E2B sandbox) | Admin → Approvals page | admin-gated decide; audited |
| Actions | `actions` | **`lib/actions.runAction` only** (service role) | dashboard | team-scoped |
| Audit | `audit_log` | `lib/api/audit` (append-only, trigger-backed) | admin | append-only; admin read |
| Ingestion runs | `ingest_runs` | **`lib/ingest/runs.recordIngestRun` only** (single writer, best-effort) — called by the scheduler (per source tick, `team_id` null = instance-wide), manual `/sync` (`lib/ingest/manual-sync`), and the codebase scan route (`POST /api/v1/codebases`) | `listRecentIngestRuns` → Admin → Integrations "Recent ingestion runs" panel | team-tier (admin area gated); records counts + the actual error messages so import/scan failures are diagnosable (the fix for silent breakage) |
| Identity | `teams`, `members`, `api_keys` | admin UI / seed / `lib/admin/*` (CLI: create/disable/delete/change-role members, rename teams, issue/revoke keys) | `lib/auth`, guards | role-gated; `key_hash` column-revoked; member disable/delete/role-change + team rename are audited (`member.disabled`/`member.deleted`/`member.role_changed`/`team.renamed`); an existing member's role is editable from **Admin → Members** (`updateMemberRole` → `setMemberRole` action); both role-change and delete refuse to touch the last active admin (no lockout) |
| Identities (author→member) | `member_emails` (email/git aliases) + `member_identities` (provider user ids: slack/linear/plane/… ) (+ `members.github_login`/`avatar_url`) | `lib/admin/*` + GitHub sync (`lib/codebases/github`) for emails; **`lib/identity/member-identities` only** (`setMemberIdentity`/`removeMemberIdentity`) for provider ids — auto-mapped by email via the shared **`lib/identity/provider-sync.syncProviderIdentities`** (Slack/Linear/Plane connectors call it in `lib/ingest/run`); admins view + correct every link in the **Admin → Members "Identities" panel** (`lib/identity/list.listMemberIdentities` reader; `linkMemberIdentity`/`unlinkMemberIdentity`/`addMemberEmail`/`removeMemberEmail` actions) — the fix for "different email per platform"; the **"Re-attribute content"** button (`reattributeIdentitiesNow` → `lib/ingest/reattribute.reattributeItems`) re-applies current mappings to already-ingested items (which were attributed at ingest time) | **`lib/identity/resolve`** (the one resolver: `byEmail` + `byProviderId`) → `lib/codebases/ingest`, `lib/ingest` Slack/Linear/Plane per-author attribution (each issue's assignee, each thread's author), costs/maturity, dashboard | team-scoped one-to-one (`unique(team_id,email)` / `unique(team_id,provider,external_id)`); cross-member remap blocked unless forced. **Slack auto-map needs `users:read.email`** (Linear/Plane carry emails via their API); else map manually |
| Identity context (per-member) | `member_profiles` (1:1: timezone, `working_hours`, `preferred_channels`, location, bio) + `member_time_off` (PTO/holiday ranges) + `member_goals` (OKRs/goals, `source`-tagged) | **`lib/identity/profile` only** (single-writer guarded; validates tz/working-hours/channel-allowlist/dates + audits) — manual self-service profile + admin edit; `member_goals.source` ≠ `manual` reserved for a future JIRA/Plane-initiative importer (idempotent on `(team,source,external_id)` via a partial unique index) | **`lib/identity/context.getMemberContext`** (folds profile + time-off + goals + projects DERIVED from `tasks.assignee`) → People page (`app/t/[team]/people/[handle]`) | team-tier only — `canSeeMemberContext` gate returns null for `external` (sole enforcement, no RLS backstop); guarded by `test/guards/member-context-tier-filter` |
| Sessions (postgres) | `auth_users`, `auth_tokens` | `lib/auth/pg-*` | `getSessionUser` | signed httpOnly cookie |
| Personal Slack token + OAuth state | `member_secrets` (per-member encrypted `xoxp` "act as me" token) + `oauth_states` (single-use OAuth nonces) | **`lib/member-secrets/manage` only** (`setMemberSecret`/`deleteMemberSecret`) for the token; **`lib/auth/slack-oauth-state` only** for nonces (mint at `GET /api/auth/slack/start`, atomically consume at `/callback`) | `getMemberSecret` → owner-only `GET /api/v1/me/slack-token` (paste path) + `GET /api/auth/slack/status` (connected/identity, never the token); nonces are consume-once, read nowhere else | token encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM, `lib/secrets`), returned only over the owner-authed token endpoint, never logged. OAuth state = signed short-TTL JWT (HS256, `AUTH_SECRET`) bound to the single-use `oauth_states` nonce → CSRF + replay guard; **residual v1 risk:** first-use code-injection if an *unused* signed state leaks within its 10-min TTL (v2: PKCE/browser-binding) |
| Rate limits | `rate_limits` | `rate_limit_hit` rpc | — | service-role only |
| Integrations | `integrations` | **`lib/integrations/manage` only** (single-writer guarded; admin server actions) | Admin → Integrations page (`lib/integrations/read`, **admin-gated** `canManageIntegrations`); `GET /api/v1/integrations` (API-key, NON-secret selections via `manage.listEnabledIntegrationSelections`); in-process Slack + Plane + Linear + GitHub runners (`lib/ingest/run` via `manage.getEnabledIntegrationsWithSecrets`) | `config` is NON-secret (per-type allowlist + secret-key rejection); the connector secret is **encrypted at rest** in `secret_ciphertext` (`lib/secrets`, AES-256-GCM) and decrypted **only in-process** for the runner — it never leaves over HTTP, not even on the API-key read. Admin-tier (no per-row `access` column): both writes (`resolveIntegrationsAdmin`) and the dashboard read (`canManageIntegrations`, in `lib/integrations/read`) are app-code gated on `role==="admin"` — no RLS backstop; guarded by `test/guards/integrations-tier-filter` + the data-mechanics tier test. **LLM provider keys** (`openai`/`anthropic`/`google`) are secret-only integration types managed in the Admin → Integrations "AI provider keys" panel; the query LLM resolves the team's key via `manage.getProviderKey` (falls back to the process env when unset). |
| Codebase analytics | `codebases`, `code_metrics`, `code_contributions`, `github_issues` | **`lib/codebases/*` only** (single-writer guarded): `lib/codebases/ingest` (full scan → all four tables; via `POST /api/v1/codebases`, pushed by the CLI `aios-ingest scan`) **+** `lib/codebases/github-api-scan` (GitHub-API contribution sync — writes `codebases` + `code_contributions` **only**, run in-process by `lib/ingest/run` on every GitHub sync). The API-sync path fills the per-person + commit-volume graphs for a **linked-but-unscanned** repo without a checkout; it **never writes `code_metrics`** (readiness/coverage/agentic need the file tree → CLI scanner) and **no-ops** once a repo has any `code_metrics` row, so it can't clobber richer scanner data | codebases pages incl. Codebases → GitHub (scan freshness via `lib/metrics/codebases.getCodebaseFreshness` + live HEAD compare `lib/codebases/github.fetchRepoHeadSha`), `lib/metrics/codebases` (headline reflects the last scan regardless of range; a repo with contributions but no `code_metrics` reads as `scanned:false`) | team-tier only; **app-code gate** (`lib/codebases/visibility` + guard) — no RLS backstop. Brain derives `agentic_score`/`health_score`; AEM `readiness_*` is scored scanner-side (`ingestion/aios_ingest/analyzers/readiness.py`) and persisted verbatim. W1.3 native UI: repo selection persists to `integrations` (type=github, admin) via the dedicated **Admin → Integrations "GitHub repositories" panel** (`components/admin/github-repos-panel` → `addGithubRepo`/`removeGithubRepo` actions → single-writer `lib/integrations/github-link`, writing one canonical github row's `config.repos`; the panel also offers already-scanned `codebases.full_name` as one-click link suggestions; **private repos**: `connectGithubToken` validates a PAT via GitHub `/user` before storing it encrypted (`lib/integrations/github-validate` + `ensureGithubIntegration`), and `checkGithubAccess` probes per-repo access — public / private-reachable / no-access — so a private repo's syncability is knowable before a sync; the importer sends the decrypted token as `Authorization: Bearer` (`lib/ingest/sources/github`)); member→GitHub linking via `linkGithub` on Admin → Members (admin); the repo selection (`config.repos`) is consumed by the in-process native GitHub importer (`lib/ingest/run`), which now **also auto-syncs contributions** on each tick (readiness/coverage still require the CLI/CI `aios-ingest scan`). Also projects each scan's `recent_commits` → searchable `items` (kind `artifact`, `frontmatter.source=git`, in the `commits` project) via `lib/codebases/commits-to-items` → `ingestItem` (author-attributed via the identity map, `team` tier) so git history is answerable in NL queries |
| Brain spend / usage meter | `query_log` (`cost_usd`, `input/output/cache_tokens`, `member_id`) | the query routes (`/api/v1/query`, `/api/dashboard/query`) — one row per answered question | `lib/metrics/pulse` (usage KPIs), `lib/metrics/members` (per-member cost + throughput-vs-cost, W1.2), Admin → Usage page | **role-scoped in app code** via `scopeQueryLog` (admins → team-wide; everyone else → own rows) — no RLS backstop; guarded by `test/guards/query-log-visibility`. Brain spend only |
| Chat history | `conversations` + `chat_messages` | **`lib/chat/store` only** (single-writer guarded) — both `POST /api/dashboard/query` (web) and `POST /api/v1/query` (machine API: CLI / Telegram-via-Hermes) create/continue a thread and persist each user+assistant turn; the conversation routes rename/archive | the `/query` sidebar + `GET /api/dashboard/conversations[/:id]`; `POST /api/dashboard/query` loads the windowed history (`recentTurns`) so follow-ups/pronouns resolve | **owner-scoped per member** — every store call filters `(team_id, member_id)`; a member sees only their own threads (no RLS backstop; the store IS the gate, guarded by `test/guards/single-writer-chat` + the chat-store data-mechanics owner-isolation test). Persists across sessions/interfaces keyed by `conversation_id`; soft-delete via `archived_at`. Distinct from `query_log` (the spend meter). |
| External AI spend | `usage_costs` | **`lib/costs/ingest` only** (via `POST /api/v1/costs`) | `lib/metrics/external-costs`, Admin → Usage page | team-tier only; workstation pushes from `aios analyze --push` (Cursor dashboard USD + session-log estimates); idempotent on `(team, member, date, provider, source, project)` |
| AEM maturity snapshots | `agentic_maturity_snapshots` | `POST /api/v1/metrics` → `lib/metrics/individual-maturity-ingest` | Maturity → People (`lib/metrics/individual-maturity`) | team-tier only; daily aggregates incl. token/cost totals from session logs; no raw session content |
| Graph memory (Graphiti) | `graph_episodes` (projection state) + **Graphiti/Neo4j** (the graph itself, self-hosted, `graphiti/`) | **`lib/graph/project` only** (single-writer guarded) — projects brain `items` (Slack transcripts) → Graphiti episodes; driven by `lib/graph/run` (`runGraphProjection`) via the admin **"Project to graph"** action (`projectToGraphNow`, admin-gated) + the `lib/graph/scheduler` interval poller (registered in `instrumentation.ts`, self-gated to inert unless `GRAPHITI_URL` set) | `POST /api/v1/graph-query` via `lib/graph/graphiti-client` | **experiment alongside** `graph_entities`/`/api/v1/query` (not a replacement). Graphiti has no tier awareness → tier is encoded in `group_id` (`<slug>_<tier>` — Graphiti rejects `:`; `lib/graph/group`) and the query scopes to `visibleGroupIds(viewerTier)` — SOLE isolation, no RLS backstop. `/messages` requires a (nullable) `role` field. LLM extraction via OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`GRAPHITI_URL`/`graphiti/.env`) |

## Auth & access tiers

This server **implements brain-api v1.3** (the wire contract; source of truth:
`aios-workspace/docs/brain-api.md`). That version is pinned in code as `BRAIN_API_VERSION`
(`lib/api/version.ts`) and asserted against this sentence by
`test/guards/contract-version.test.ts` — bump all three together on a contract change.

Two principals, one tier model:

- **Humans** — invite-only, **passwordless via magic link**. `POST /api/auth/request-magic-link`
  issues + emails a single-use token (`issueMagicToken`/`sendMagicLink`; unknown emails still
  get an explicit 403, matching the prior direct-login UX) and never sets a session cookie
  itself. Clicking the emailed link hits `GET /auth/confirm`, which verifies + consumes the
  token (`redeemMagicToken`) and is the ONLY place that sets the session cookie
  (`jose`-signed httpOnly, `lib/auth/pg-session`). A member's **first** redemption (an invite
  being activated) routes through `/auth/welcome` — name, team, and inviter (resolved from the
  append-only `audit_log`, no `invited_by` column needed) — before landing on the dashboard;
  later logins redirect straight through. `POST /api/auth/login` (direct-by-email, no
  ownership proof, no email round-trip) is now **dev-only** — 404s in production unless
  `ALLOW_DEV_LOGIN=1` — mirroring `/auth/dev-login`'s existing gate exactly.
- **Machines** — per-member API key `aios_<key_id>_<secret>` (sha256 at rest, shown
  once). Sync writes use the **service role** — confined to `lib/ingest`
  and audited on every write.
- **Tiers** — `team` (sees all) vs `external` (sees only external). `admin`/`private`
  are rejected with **422** at the API and never reach the database.

## Key flows

### Sync ingest — `POST /api/v1/items`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as CLI / sidecar
  participant R as route.ts
  participant I as lib/ingest
  participant DB as Postgres
  C->>R: Bearer key + X-AIOS-Team + ItemPayload

  Note over R: admin/private → 422
  R->>I: ingestItem(payload, tier)
  I->>DB: upsert project; lookup item by (team,project,path)

### Grounded query — `POST /api/v1/query` (SSE)

```mermaid

  Q->>RET: tier-filtered FTS top-12 + recent + Graphiti semantic expansion + structured digest (git + per-person activity digests included only for activity questions — context shaping)
  RET-->>Q: {sources[], structured}
  Q->>CL: streamAnswer(ctx, question, keys, history, caller, timeZone)  %% caller = signed-in member (name/email/handle) so first-person "how about me?" resolves; timeZone anchors relative dates ("today" = last 24h in the user's tz); ctx.grounded=false → abstain note (stay-quiet)
  CL->>LLM: cached system + date/tz anchor + caller anchor + numbered sources + question
  LLM-->>U: SSE delta* then sources then done(usage)

### PM progression loop — merged work → done in the primary PM tool (Linear)

```mermaid

  WF --> API["POST /api/v1/work-events"]
  API --> EVT["lib/work-events"]
  EVT --> TASKS[("tasks.status = done")]

  LINKS --> PMS["lib/pm-sync provider adapter"]
  PMS --> LINEAR["Linear completed workflow state (primary)"]
  PMS --> PLANE["Plane completed state (legacy adapter)"]
  EVT --> UNRES["unresolved work_events for admin reconciliation"]
```

AIOS task `row_key` is the durable work identity. Optional `PM` / `PM URL`
columns in `tasks.md` materialize into `task_pm_links`; the provider secret still
lives only in `integrations.secret_ciphertext` and is decrypted on the server-side
sync path. Provider failures update `task_pm_links.last_error` and the task remains
done — PM drift is visible, not allowed to roll back completed code work.

**Full projection engine (brain → PM, one-way, brain wins).** As of brain-api v1.2 the
`tasks` table is the source of truth that **projects** a structured board into the team's
single `teams.primary_pm_provider`. `lib/pm-sync/project.ts` owns this:
`projectTask()` upserts one task (resolving its epic parent first, then the work item),
and `projectAllTasks()` projects a whole `(team, project)` in topological order with a
~1 req/s throttle — the server-side replacement for the seed scripts. Each adapter's
`upsertWorkItem()` **adopts-or-creates** (Plane by `external_id` across
`["aios-backlog","aios"]`; Linear by the `aios-ext: <row_key> · source: …` footer marker),
then **brain-wins PATCHes** title/body/state/priority/labels/parent and Plane Wave-module
membership. A `projection_fingerprint` on the link skips a provider round-trip when nothing
changed (a second `projectAllTasks` run does zero writes). The admin **"Project board now"**
button (`projectBoardAction`, admin-gated + audited) on the pm-sync page triggers a full run;
the work-events done path calls `projectTask` (creating the link/item if missing). `moveToDone`
remains as a thin state-only delegate. Assignee projection is deferred.

**Inbound divergence detection (brain-api v1.2 Phase 5, surface-only).** The reconcile pass
(`lib/pm-sync/reconcile.ts: reconcileProviderState`) reads the primary tool's CURRENT workflow
state for every linked task (adapter `fetchSeenStates` — read-only), records it on
`task_pm_links.provider_seen_status`, and surfaces any item whose state has drifted from the brain's
`last_projected_status`. It is **SURFACE-ONLY (brain wins)**: it never mutates the provider and never
changes brain `tasks.status` — the only write is `provider_seen_status`, and only when it changed
(so a second pass does zero writes — idempotent). The admin **"Check for divergence"** button
(`reconcileDivergenceAction`, admin-gated + audited) runs it; the PM-sync page renders the divergence
list read-only from stored state (`isDiverged`). Conflict policy is fixed at brain-wins: drift is
shown for a human to pull, never silently applied. Two-way write-back remains out of scope.

**Inbound Plane import (Plane → brain, in-app runner).** The *opposite* direction from the
projection engine: `lib/ingest/sources/plane.ts` + `plane-normalize.ts` pull a Plane project's
work-items **into** the brain as tasks, run in-process by `lib/ingest/run.ts: runPlaneIngestion`
(scheduler tick + the admin **"Sync now"** button on a Plane integration; actor = the auto-provisioned
`plane-sync` connector member). It shares the low-level HTTP client with the outbound adapter via
`lib/pm-sync/plane-client.ts`. Two invariants keep it from fighting the projection engine:
> • **Dedicated brain project per Plane project** (`plane-<identifier>`). `materializeTasks`'
> diff-delete is **project-wide**, so a Plane import must never share a project with CLI/UI tasks
> or each run would delete the other's rows. Each import emits ONE `kind="task"` item whose `rows[]`
> are the whole project, so a work-item removed in Plane diff-deletes from the brain — within that
> project only.
> • **One-directional, de-dupe over exclude.** Items the brain itself projected OUT (`external_source`
> starting `aios`) are **skipped** on import — the brain already owns that `row_key` in its real
> project, so re-importing would duplicate (this preserves "brain wins"). Plane-native items import
> fresh, keyed by `<IDENTIFIER>-<sequence_id>`. Sub-issue `parent` → `parent_row_key` (resolved only
> within the imported set; a skipped/absent parent is nulled, never dangling), module → `sprint`
> (round-trip-consistent with pm-sync's "Wave" mapping), cycle → a namespaced `cycle:<name>` label
> (iterations have no dedicated task column), labels/state/priority/assignee carried through. Imports
> stay at **team tier**; the runner does not
> populate `task_pm_links`, so an imported task is not re-projected back out.
> • **Searchable issue text.** Alongside the task item, the runner also writes ONE `kind="deliverable"`
> item **per work-item** (`normalizePlaneDocs` → `plane/<slug>/<id>.md`) carrying the title +
> HTML→text description, so Plane prose is full-text searchable via the `items.search` column — not
> just the terse task table. Round-trippers are skipped here too; this is the content pattern
> (keyed by path, idempotent by sha, not diff-deleted).

**Inbound Linear & GitHub import (same pattern as Plane).** Two more in-app task importers, each
mirroring the Plane design (dedicated project, one `kind="task"` item, project-wide diff-delete, team
tier, `run<X>Ingestion` + scheduler tick + admin "Sync now"):
> • **Linear** — `lib/ingest/sources/linear.ts` + `linear-normalize.ts`, sharing the GraphQL client
> `lib/pm-sync/linear-client.ts` with the outbound adapter. Project `linear-<teamKey>`, row_key = the
> Linear identifier (`ENG-123`). Linear **is** the pm-sync provider, so it has the same round-trip risk:
> issues carrying the `aios-ext: <row_key>` footer (the projection's idempotency marker, now shared in
> `linear-client`) are **de-duped/skipped**. `state.type` → status, priority int → word, sub-issue
> `parent` → `parent_row_key`, project → `sprint`, cycle → `cycle:<name>` label. Like Plane, it also
> writes a searchable `kind="deliverable"` item per issue (`normalizeLinearDocs` →
> `linear/<teamKey>/<identifier>.md`, title + description).
> • **GitHub** — two complementary native sources per repo in `config.repos`, both into project
> `github-<owner>-<repo>`:
>   - **Issues → tasks** (`github.ts` + `github-normalize.ts`, REST, public repos token-free): one
>     `kind="task"` item, row_key = `GH-<n>`. PRs dropped; `open` → backlog (or a workflow label like
>     "in progress"/"blocked"), `closed` → done; milestone → `sprint`, labels/assignees carried.
>     GitHub is **not** a pm-sync provider, so no round-trip loop — idempotency is row_key + sha.
>   - **Repo files → deliverables** (`github-files.ts` + `github-files-normalize.ts`): the native port
>     of the Python sidecar's GitHub source — walks the default branch's tree, keeps files matching
>     `config.fileGlobs` (default `*.md`/`*.mdx`), and writes ONE `kind="deliverable"` item **per file**
>     (path `github/<owner>-<repo>/<filepath>`, idempotent by path+sha, content pattern like Slack — not
>     diff-deleted). This is content/knowledge ingestion, distinct from the task importer.
>
> Together these replace the Python sidecar's `linear`/`github` inbound sources — **both have been
> removed** from the sidecar (dropped from the registry, `_SELECTION_TRANSLATORS`, and the
> `drift:sources` list). The GitHub *codebase analytics* scanner (`analyzers/codebase.py`,
> `lib/codebases/*`) is independent and remains.

**Reactive triggers (brain-api v1.2 Phase 2).** Projection is no longer manual-only. Task UI
writes — `createTaskAction` / `moveTaskAction` / the new `updateTaskAction` (title/sprint/due/
parent/labels/priority/body) — schedule a single-row `projectTask` via `next/server`'s `after()`
(`lib/pm-sync/after-write.ts: projectTaskByIdAfterWrite`). Sync **pushes** (`POST /api/v1/items`,
task kind) schedule `projectChangedTasksAfterWrite` for **only the rows whose projected fields
changed this push** — `lib/ingest` computes the changed set by diffing the projectable columns
(title/status/sprint/priority/labels/parent — not assignee/due/body) against a pre-upsert snapshot
(`lib/ingest/projectable-diff.ts`), so an unchanged backlog never re-projects. These callbacks run
**after** the response and **never fail** the originating action/push — on error they only record
`task_pm_links.last_error`; the `projection_fingerprint` skip keeps them from re-writing the board.
The manual `projectBoardAction` and the inline work-events projection remain.

**Dashboard hierarchical CRUD (brain-api v1.2 Phase 4).** The tasks page (`app/t/[team]/tasks`)
is the second authoring surface alongside `aios push`. It **server-renders the hierarchy** —
`components/kanban/task-hierarchy.tsx` groups sub-tasks under their epic (by `parent_row_key`) and
shows each task's primary-provider link + sync status. Editing a task (`components/kanban/
edit-task-dialog.tsx`) calls `updateTaskAction`, which writes the projectable fields and schedules
the same reactive `after()` projection. `updateTaskAction` enforces **parent integrity** —
self-parent, missing parent, and **cycle** (it walks the proposed parent's ancestor chain over the
project's edges) are all rejected before the write. PM-link badges are loaded by a **sibling
`task_pm_links` query grouped in JS**, not a PostgREST embed: the pg adapter only supports to-many
embeds as `(count)`, so an embedded `task_pm_links(...)` select returns no rows on the postgres
backend.

**Seed scripts (retired, Phase 3).** The backlog was originally authored in a `BACKLOG`
constant (`scripts/aios-backlog.mjs`) and one-way-pushed into the boards by
`scripts/{plane,linear}-backlog.mjs` (+ `plane-views.mjs`, `pm-sync-backfill.ts`). The
projection engine above fully supersedes them: the brain `tasks` table is now the source of
truth and projects the board. Once the live backlog was migrated into `tasks`, those scripts
and their npm entries (`plane:backlog` / `linear:backlog` / `plane:views` / `pm:backfill`) were
**deleted** (brain-api v1.2 Phase 3). The board is created/updated only via `lib/pm-sync`.

**PM tool decision (resolved).** The Plane-vs-Linear bake-off (backlog epic W2.4) is settled —
**Linear is the chosen PM tool**, and `teams.primary_pm_provider` is set to `linear`. The Plane
adapter (`lib/pm-sync/plane.ts`) remains in code so the runtime projection path stays
provider-neutral, but Plane is no longer used and the Plane seed/mirror scripts are gone.

### Action layer (Organ 4) — policy-gated execution

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  REQ["POST /api/v1/actions<br/>{type, resource, params}"] --> REC["record actions row (requested)"]
  REC --> AUTH["authorize() — lib/policy"]
  AUTH --> D{effect}
  D -- deny --> DEN["status=denied (default-deny)"]
  D -- require_approval --> Q["fileApprovalRequest()<br/>→ approval_requests; status=pending_approval"]
  D -- allow --> H["handler.execute()"]
  H -- "note.create" --> ING["lib/ingest (audited write)"]

  H --> RES["status=succeeded/failed + result"]
  DEN & Q & RES --> AUD["audit_log"]
```

A queued (`pending_approval`) action is resolved by `resolveApproval()` (called by the
session-authed dashboard; app-code role checks restrict deciding to admins/leads): **approve** resumes and
executes the handler, **deny** marks the action denied — both audited, and a second
decision is rejected. Code execution uses an **E2B** `SandboxRunner`
(`lib/actions/sandbox/e2b.ts`, opt-in: `npm i @e2b/code-interpreter` + `E2B_API_KEY`);
self-host deployments can wire a microsandbox adapter against the same interface.

## Invariants & gotchas

Each entry is a real contract or bug, stated as the invariant that must now hold. Where a
guard enforces it, it's named.

- **Single-writer for content.** Only `lib/ingest` writes `items`/`item_versions`.
  *Guard:* `test/guards/single-writer-items.test.ts` (fails the build on any other writer).
- **Ingest is idempotent by `content_sha256`.** Identical re-push → `unchanged`, no new
  `item_versions` row. *Verified:* `test/datamechanics/ingest.datamechanics.test.ts` (real PG).
- **Tier isolation.** An `external`-tier principal never reads `team`/`admin` content. Enforced
  in app code (no RLS, no DB backstop). Enforced in three
  places, all verified on real PG: the retrieval path (`retrieve.ts`), the API routes (they
  re-apply the filter), and the dashboard reads (`app/t/[team]/*`) — which now route every
  `items` read through the **`lib/auth/visibility` choke-point** (`visibleItems`/`canSeeAccess`).
  *Guard:* `test/guards/dashboard-tier-filter.test.ts` fails the build if a dashboard page reads
  `items` without the choke-point. *Verified:* `access-isolation` + `dashboard-visibility`
  data-mechanics tests.
  🟡 **Not yet built — within-team privacy.** The tier model is binary (`team`/`external`); a
  `team` member sees *all* `team` content. "Private to a subset of the team" (e.g. an ingested
  private Slack thread hidden from other team members) needs a finer-grained ACL (per-member or
  per-channel) and a new tier/scope — a product feature, not covered by the current filter.
- **`admin`/`private` tiers never reach the DB** — rejected with 422 at the API.
- **Append-only audit.** `audit_log` has a trigger that blocks UPDATE/DELETE.
- **The brain is the source of truth; the PM board is a one-way projection.** The `tasks` table is
  canonical (v1.2: hierarchy + `body`). The brain projects task create/update/state into the single
  `teams.primary_pm_provider` board (Plane/Linear) — never the reverse in v1. Projection fires both
  **manually** (admin "Project board now") and **reactively** (v1.2 Phase 2): task UI writes
  (`create`/`move`/`updateTaskAction`) and changed-row pushes (`POST /api/v1/items`) schedule it via
  `after()` — bounded to the rows whose projected fields changed, run after the response, and never
  failing the user action (errors → `task_pm_links.last_error` only; `projection_fingerprint` skips
  redundant writes). A merged-work event still marks the matching task done first; provider failures
  are surfaced in Admin → PM sync, never rolling the task back. Inbound PM→brain divergence is
  **detected and surfaced** (Phase 5, `reconcileProviderState`): drift between the tool's state and
  `last_projected_status` is recorded on `provider_seen_status` and shown on the PM-sync page —
  surface-only, brain wins, never written back. Two-way write-back remains out of scope.
  (Rows removed from a push are diff-deleted in `tasks` but **not** deleted from the PM board in
  Phase 2 — PM deletion-on-diff is a later phase.)
- **`key_hash` is column-revoked** from client roles; API secrets are sha256-at-rest, shown once.
- **Migration replay.** 14-digit timestamp prefixes, unique, lexical == chronological.
  *Guards:* `test/guards/migrations-numbering.test.ts` + `npm run db:test:up` (migrates from zero).

## Changing X? read this

- **Add/remove an API route, DB table, or ingestion source** → update the `<!-- drift:* -->`
  inventories below (machine-guarded; CI + pre-push will fail otherwise).
- **Write to `items`/`item_versions`** → it must live in `lib/ingest` (single-writer guard).
- **Read tiered content on the dashboard** → apply the `access`/tier filter explicitly; there is
  no RLS backstop.
- **Add a migration** → 14-digit timestamp prefix; run `npm run db:test:up` to prove replay.
- **Change access control** → add/extend a data-mechanics test that proves tier isolation on real PG.
- **Change the brain-api wire contract** → the contract is pinned in
  `aios-workspace/docs/brain-api.md`; bump `BRAIN_API_VERSION` (`lib/api/version.ts`) and this
  doc's `v<version>` references together (guard: `test/guards/contract-version.test.ts`).
- **Cross the module boundary** → `lib/` is the backend domain layer (never imports `app/`), and
  `app/` reaches the DB only through the data-client factories (`lib/db/server|admin`), never
  `lib/db/pg` internals. Both directions are enforced by `import/no-restricted-paths` in
  `eslint.config.mjs`.

## Keeping this doc honest

The drift inventories (routes/tables/sources) are machine-checked. The sources-of-truth table,
the Mermaid flows, and the invariants are **hand-maintained** — update them in the same PR as the
change and bump the "Last verified" date when you reconcile against code.

## Repository inventories

These lists are **machine-checked** against the code on every PR. Update them in the same
PR as the code change, or the [drift guard](#docs-drift-guard) fails.

## Docs drift guard

`scripts/check-docs-drift.mjs` derives the three inventories above from code
(`app/api/**/route.ts`, `postgres/schema.sql`, `ingestion/.../registry.py`) and
diffs them against the `<!-- drift:* -->` blocks. It runs in three places:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, job *Docs drift guard*) — on every PR. Advisory until
  the repo's plan allows a required status check; then make it required on `main`.
- **Local pre-push hook** (`.githooks/pre-push`) — blocks a push that would drift the docs.
  Auto-enabled by `npm install` (the `prepare` script sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks`);
  bypass in an emergency with `git push --no-verify`.

```bash
npm run check:docs   # run locally before pushing
```

When you add/remove a route, table, or source: update the matching block here in the same
PR. The guard verifies structure only — keep the diagrams and prose accurate by review.
